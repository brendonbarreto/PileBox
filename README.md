# Pile Box challenge

This challenge is a great way to test your knowledge, and an even better way to say hello to new languages

## The challenge

The main goal is to calculate the height of a stack of boxes. Each box has a height and a width that will be informed. But it's not as simple as it sounds ...

### The problem

### Test Case

To ensure that the application is calculating the height of the stack correctly, basically 3 tests are required. If you succeed in all, congratulations you won

The boxes should be added sequentially, and conform to the specified sizes.

**[x, y] = A box with x of width and y of height**

```
Test 1: [2, 2] -> [1, 1] -> [1, 2] -> [2, 1] = 4
Test 2: [5, 7] -> [3, 4] -> [1, 2] -> [2, 3] -> [4, 2] -> [4, 4] = 11
Test 3: [3, 1] -> [2, 2] -> [1, 3] -> [6, 9] -> [5, 8] -> [3, 7] -> [4, 2] -> [3, 1] -> [2, 2] -> [1, 4] = 14 
```
